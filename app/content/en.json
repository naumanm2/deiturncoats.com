This is not the moment to turn our backs—DEI is definitely not out. \n\n Väestöliitto is committed to defending equality in Finland and around the world. The campaign gathers funds in Finland to support work promoting the rights and equality of women and girls, people with disabilities, and LGBTQ+ communities in developing countries. \n\n With your help, more people can live freely and chase their dreams—just as they are.\n\n For companies: If your business wants to take a stronger stand for equality, we offer broader partnership opportunities.
